# Image Resize App

#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/L5tyC0_MpNY
#### Description:

###### This is a simple Flask app that allows user to upload and resize their image. 

###### In order to achieve this, I used PIL library to process images from users. 
###### More specifically, I used resize method from PIL library, which takes a width and height as its inputs and generate an image based on the input size.

###### Currently the funcion of the app in terms of how it process images is still very limited, but it can be a quick and useful tool when users want to quickly crop/ edit the size of their images. 

###### Further possible developments for this app is to enhance the resize function, which allows users to drag and choose which part of the image they want to keep.
